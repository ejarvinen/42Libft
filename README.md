# 42Libft

A re-coded library of functions that should act exactly or close to their corresponding C Standard Library functions. This library contains a few basic singly linked list tools as well as some additional c-string manipulation tools.

### Compilation

`git clone` to desired repository. `cd` to that repository and run `make` to compile the mandatory part of the library. To add linked list tools to the library, run `make bonus` after running `make`.
